# Campaing-Monitor-API-web-app

In master branch is included the source code.
This is a web app for the Measurement of some Google Analytics events like Clicks of the user, Consent to track its actions,time to response to the deletion and addition of a subscriber etc.
I used gtag for the tracking of these metrics by creating a tracking id (G-XXXXXXXXXX) in my Google Analytics account.
I am using CampaignMonitor's API to manage a subscribers list (add or remove subscriber and tracking the subscribers list) https://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/
